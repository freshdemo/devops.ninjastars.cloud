## Step 1 - Install the .Net SDK

`mkdir -p $HOME/dotnet`

`tar zxf dotnet-sdk-8.0.100-osx-arm64.tar.gz -C $HOME/dotnet`

## Step 2 - Install the ASP.NET Core Runtime

This letâ€™s you run apps in a webserver.

`tar zxf aspnetcore-runtime-8.0.0-osx-arm64.tar.gz -C $HOME/dotnet`

## Step 3 - Install the .NET Runtime

This lets you run console apps.

`tar zxf dotnet-runtime-8.0.0-osx-arm64.tar.gz -C $HOME/dotnet`

Tell your system where to access .NET by adding the following lines to your ~/.zshrc file. You can also enter these on the terminal to getting it working, but new terminal windows will not have the settings;
